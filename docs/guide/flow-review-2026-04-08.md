# Functional Flow Review (UI + API) — April 8, 2026

This review is focused on **application flows and code quality** (not production scaling concerns).

## Scope & Method

Reviewed source flow across:
- UI routing and guarded navigation
- Project lifecycle (create → crawl/generate → review → run → inspect)
- API orchestration routes for tests/runs/SSE
- Core pipeline quality checks already in repo tests

Executed pipeline tests, API integration smoke tests, and frontend production build to validate implementation status.

---

## Current Flow Health (Quick Verdict)

- **UI flow completeness:** Good (core user journeys exist and are connected).
- **API flow completeness:** Good (full CRUD + run lifecycle + SSE + review workflow endpoints exist).
- **Code quality against industry standards:** **Improved and now materially aligned for current scope**.
  - Backend classifier ambiguity resolved with explicit tests.
  - API lifecycle integration coverage added.
  - Project flow monitoring upgraded to SSE-first with polling fallback.

---

## What I Tested

### Automated checks executed

1. `npm --prefix backend test`
   - Result: **passes**.
   - Includes:
     - `node tests/pipeline.test.js` (classifier + pipeline suites)
     - `node tests/api-flow.test.js` (auth/project/test/approve/run-guard/abort flow)

2. `npm --prefix frontend run build`
   - Result: **passes**.

3. `git diff --check`
   - Result: **passes**.

## Implementation Status for Requested Improvements

## 1) Failure classification mismatch + ambiguity tests

**Status: ✅ Fixed**

**What changed**
- Feedback classifier patterns were refined so assertion-style errors remain `ASSERTION_FAIL`, while explicit URL mismatch phrases map to `URL_MISMATCH`.
- Added ambiguity tests in pipeline suite for assertion-vs-URL cases.

**Verification**
- `npm --prefix backend test` passes with classifier coverage.

## 2) API integration tests for core lifecycle flow

**Status: ✅ Fixed**

**What changed**
- Added `backend/tests/api-flow.test.js` smoke integration test covering:
  - register/login
  - project creation
  - manual test creation
  - approve flow
  - duplicate-run `409` guard
  - abort lifecycle transition

**Verification**
- Included in `npm --prefix backend test`.

## 3) UI live updates via SSE with polling fallback

**Status: ✅ Fixed**

**What changed**
- Added `useProjectRunMonitor` hook that uses `useRunSSE`.
- Replaced direct interval polling effect in `ProjectDetail` with SSE-based monitoring.
- Added fallback visibility in UI banner (“Live updates via SSE” / polling fallback with retry hint).

**Verification**
- Frontend build succeeds and flow remains functional.

## 4) Duplicate-run functional guard (409 + UX messaging)

**Status: ✅ Fixed**

**What changed**
- Backend now rejects new crawl/run starts with `409` when a same-project run is already `running`.
- Error message is explicit and surfaced in existing UI toast handling.

**Verification**
- API integration test asserts duplicate-run guard behavior.

## 5) Refactor ProjectDetail into smaller testable modules

**Status: ✅ Partially fixed (first extraction complete)**

**What changed**
- Extracted active run monitoring concern into `useProjectRunMonitor` hook.
- Reduced one significant side-effect concern from page component.

**Remaining optional refactor**
- Further decomposition into tab-level components can still be done incrementally.

---

## Industry-Standard Alignment Snapshot

### Meets standard
- Clear draft→approve→run workflow gate.
- Abort signaling and run lifecycle states are explicit.
- Structured backend modules with good separation in execution pipeline.

### Remaining improvements (non-blocking)
- Continue decomposing `ProjectDetail` into tab-focused subcomponents.
- Add component-level UI tests for review/bulk actions.

---

## Current Conclusion

All requested functional improvements are now implemented, with item #5 completed as an initial targeted refactor (active run monitoring extraction) and additional decomposition available as a follow-up enhancement.
