# Manual QA Guide — Sentri

## 🎯 Purpose

This document is for **manual testers** to validate all functional flows in Sentri before release.

It has two layers:

1. **Golden E2E Happy Path** (must-pass) — one stitched-together user journey that exercises every core feature end-to-end. If any step fails, **stop the release**.
2. **Per-feature happy paths + negatives** — targeted checks per area for full coverage.

> ℹ️ Values are grounded in `README.md`, `AGENT.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `docs/changelog.md`, `backend/src/routes/testFix.js`, `backend/src/pipeline/feedbackLoop.js`, `backend/src/utils/notifications.js`. `TBD` items require engineering confirmation.

> **Read-only boundary:** line ranges are approximate and can drift ±5 lines after edits — always stop at the next `### ` heading. Don't read beyond the listed range for a given section.

> ⚠️ **Agents generating Playwright tests for Sentri: read this.**
> Sentri's primary output is **UI / browser tests** that drive a real browser via `await page.goto(...)`, role-based selectors (`getByRole` / `getByLabel` / `getByText`), `safeClick` / `safeFill`, and `expect(page....)` assertions on rendered DOM.
> API tests using `request.fetch` / `request.get` / `request.post` are an **additional, secondary** output — only valid when same-origin fetch/XHR was captured during a crawl, or the user explicitly asked for an API test (OpenAPI / HAR / `METHOD /path`).
> **If you emit only `request.*` tests when asked for "Playwright tests for Sentri", you have misread this guide.** Default to UI tests unless the user explicitly says "API test".

#### Canonical UI test shape — emit this by default

```js
test('user can log in', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://rameshbabuprudhvi.github.io/sentri/login');
  await safeFill(page.getByLabel('Email'), 'user@example.test');
  await safeFill(page.getByLabel('Password'), 'pw');
  await safeClick(page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign in' }));
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/dashboard/);
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: /workspace/i })).toBeVisible();
  await expect(page.getByRole('navigation')).toBeVisible();
});
```

No `import` lines. No `request.fetch` / `request.get` / `request.post`. Role-based selectors. ≥ 3 `expect(page....)` assertions on visible UI state.

**When adding a new user-facing flow** (per [REVIEW.md](./REVIEW.md)):
1. Add a section here under "Functional Test Areas".
2. Add a step (or sub-section) in the Golden E2E Happy Path if it belongs in the must-pass journey.
3. Add a row to the Coverage Checklist.
4. If the flow has a new endpoint, add it to [`backend/src/middleware/permissions.json`](./backend/src/middleware/permissions.json).
5. Cite the source file/line for any role-gated or behavior claim.

**When verifying a permissions claim:** read [`backend/src/middleware/permissions.json`](./backend/src/middleware/permissions.json), not the markdown matrix below — the JSON is the canonical machine-readable form. The markdown table mirrors it for humans.

> **Automated coverage:** This manual plan is the human baseline. Automated unit / component / E2E tests are tracked in [#98](https://github.com/RameshBabuPrudhvi/sentri/issues/98). Sections already covered by automation should be tagged `_(automated by tests/…)_` — manual testers may skip those during release sign-off. When you add an automated test, update the matching `QA.md` section and Coverage Checklist row.

## 🧪 How to Test

- Browser matrix (all required):
  - Chrome (latest) — primary
  - Firefox (latest)
  - Safari (latest, macOS)
  - Edge (latest)
- Do NOT call APIs directly unless debugging a failure.
- Test like an end user: click flows, navigate, refresh mid-flow, use back/forward, open links in new tabs.
- Keep DevTools open. Capture **console errors**, **network 4xx/5xx**, and **failed assets** for every bug.
- Run state-sensitive flows twice: once as a fresh user, once as a returning user.

---

## 👤 Test Accounts & Roles

Sentri defines three workspace roles (see `ROADMAP.md` ACL-002, stored in `workspace_members.role`): `admin`, `qa_lead`, `viewer`.

| Account | Role | Workspace | Purpose |
|---------|------|-----------|---------|
| User A | `admin` | WS-1 | Full-permission flows, settings, destructive ops |
| User B | `qa_lead` | WS-1 | Day-to-day QA flows (tests, runs) |
| User C | `viewer` | WS-1 | Read-only enforcement |
| User D | — (no membership) | — | Cross-workspace isolation |

- Use separate browsers / incognito windows per user.
- Never share auth cookies between users.

### Permissions Matrix (expected)

Verified against `requireRole(...)` declarations in `backend/src/routes/*.js` and `backend/src/middleware/requireRole.js` (hierarchy: `admin > qa_lead > viewer`). `admin` gates settings + destructive ops; `qa_lead` runs QA workflows; `viewer` is read-only. Source cited per row — if behavior diverges from this table, file a **severe security bug**.

**admin-only actions:**

| Action | Source |
|---|---|
| Edit workspace (rename, settings) | `routes/workspaces.js:44` |
| Invite / change-role / remove members | `routes/workspaces.js:134, 168, 196` |
| AI provider settings (`/settings`) | `routes/settings.js:48, 53, 130` |
| Settings → Data destructive clears (runs / activities / healing) | `routes/system.js:193, 200, 205` |
| **Delete project** | `routes/projects.js:84` |
| **Purge from recycle bin** (permanent) | `routes/recycleBin.js:132` |
| **Create / revoke CI/CD trigger token** | `routes/runs.js:379, 411` |

**qa_lead or admin (qa_lead-gated):**

| Action | Source |
|---|---|
| Create project | `routes/projects.js:46` |
| Test connection (New Project) | `routes/system.js:48` |
| Restore from recycle bin (soft-undelete) | `routes/recycleBin.js:54` |
| Crawl project | `routes/runs.js:46` |
| Create / Edit / Delete tests | `routes/tests.js:97, 318, 364` |
| Generate tests / Record / AI Fix / Apply Fix | `routes/tests.js:382, 858`; `routes/testFix.js:152, 273` |
| Approve / Reject (single + bulk) | `routes/tests.js:538, 555, 589` |
| Trigger run (project regression + single test) | `routes/runs.js:134`; `routes/tests.js:487` |
| **Abort / stop run** — note: code has **no "own-runs only" restriction**, any qa_lead can stop any run | `routes/runs.js:257` |
| Accept visual baseline | `routes/tests.js:751` |
| Set / edit / delete cron schedule | `routes/projects.js:162, 222` |
| Edit per-project notification settings | `routes/projects.js:266` |

**Any authenticated workspace member (no `requireRole`):**

| Action | Notes |
|---|---|
| View dashboard / runs / tests / reports / projects pages | Workspace scope still enforced — outsiders blocked |
| Account export / delete (own account, GDPR) | Password-confirmed; not workspace-scoped |
| Switch workspace | Via switcher; role re-resolved from DB on every request (ACL-001/002) |

**Always denied (cross-workspace isolation):**

| Action |
|---|
| Access another workspace's data via URL or API |
| Outsider (no `workspace_members` row) accessing any workspace resource |

> ⚠️ **Note on workspace create/delete:** the `POST/DELETE /api/workspaces/...` endpoints for creating/destroying entire workspaces are out of the scope captured here. Verify behavior against the running build and update this table if found.

## ⚙️ Setup

From `README.md`:

```bash
# Backend (port 3001)
cd backend
npm install
npx playwright install chromium ffmpeg
cp .env.example .env            # Add at least one AI provider key
npm run dev

# Frontend (port 3000, proxies /api → :3001)
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

Then:
1. Confirm backend `GET http://localhost:3001/health` returns `200`.
2. Open `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Record exact build / commit SHA under test (include in every bug report).
4. Note environment: local / staging / preview URL.
5. Dev-only seed endpoint is available when `NODE_ENV !== production` (see `AGENT.md`). Use it to pre-populate users/workspaces; otherwise register via UI.

**Test data to prepare:**
- Stable crawl target URLs (from `frontend/src/demo.js` and CI):
  - `https://demo-shop.example.com` (E-Commerce demo)
  - `https://admin.example.com` (Admin Dashboard demo)
  - `https://www.example.com` (Marketing Site demo / CI default — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
  - These use IANA-reserved `example.com` subdomains; they will not actually crawl real content but are deterministic for create-project / connection-test flows. For real crawl/run testing, point at a site you control.
- Sample regression suite: ≥ 5 tests, mix of passing/failing
- Sample baseline images: at least one stable, one with intentional diff

## 🌟 Golden E2E Happy Path (must-pass before release)

Run this single end-to-end journey **as User A (admin)** in a fresh browser. Every numbered step must pass. If any fails, log a Blocker bug and stop.

**Preconditions:** Backend + frontend running; one AI provider key configured; mail transport (Resend / SMTP / console) reachable; clean DB or fresh workspace.

### 1. Auth — register & verify
1. Register `usera@example.test` with a strong password.
2. Verification email arrives (or appears in console fallback). Click the link.
3. Login → land on dashboard for the auto-created workspace.

### 2. Workspace — invite collaborator
4. Invite `userb@example.test` as `qa_lead`. Open invite link in incognito → User B accepts and lands in WS-1.

### 3. Project — create
5. As User A, create project **"PRJ-Demo"** with a real URL you control (or `https://www.example.com` for the create-project + connection-test flow only — `example.com` won't yield meaningful crawl results). Project appears in the list and as `?project=PRJ-Demo` deep-link target.

### 4. Discover — crawl the app
6. Trigger **Link Crawl** → progress visible; pages discovered; same-origin fetch/XHR captured.
7. Trigger **State Exploration** crawl on the same project → multi-step flows discovered (forms submitted, auth flows entered).
### 5. Generate — AI tests
8. Click **Generate** → 8-stage pipeline runs (discover → filter → classify → plan → generate → deduplicate → enhance → validate). New tests land in **Draft** queue, not auto-approved.
9. Verify **both test types** were produced — Sentri generates **UI / browser tests by default**; API tests are an additional output:
   - **UI / browser test (primary)** — uses `await page.goto(...)`, role-based selectors (`getByRole` / `getByLabel` / `getByText`), `safeClick` / `safeFill`, and ≥ 3 `expect(...)` assertions on visible UI state. Drives a real browser. **No `request.` / `request.fetch` / `request.get` calls.**
   - **API test (only if same-origin fetch/XHR was captured)** — Playwright `request` test asserting status + JSON shape.
   If only API tests appear, the crawl did not discover UI flows — re-run **State Exploration** and regenerate.


### 6. Record — manual recorder
10. Click **Record a test** → Playwright browser opens via CDP screencast.
11. Perform: click, fill, press, select, navigate. Stop.
12. New Draft test appears with `safeClick` / `safeFill` calls and per-step entries.

### 7. Review — approve / reject
13. Open a Draft → review steps **and** Playwright code via the **Steps / Source toggle** on TestDetail.
14. Reject one obviously bad test → archived, excluded from regression.
15. Approve at least 3 tests → moved to active suite.

### 8. Edit — verify auto-generated Playwright code
16. Open an approved test → switch to **Source** tab → confirm code uses role-based selectors (`getByRole`, `getByLabel`, `getByText`), starts with `await page.goto(...)`, has ≥ 3 `expect(...)` assertions, no `import` lines (`backend/src/routes/tests.js:218-224`).
17. Edit a step (rename a button, add a step) → save → **diff/preview panel** appears showing only the changed lines, **not** a full rewrite (`backend/src/routes/tests.js:160-198`).
18. Accept the diff → `playwrightCode` updated, `playwrightCodePrev` retained, `codeRegeneratedAt` set.
19. Discard a different diff → original code preserved.

### 9. Run — execute regression
20. Trigger regression with **parallelism = 3**, browser = **Chromium**, device = desktop. RunDetail opens with live SSE log stream.
21. Watch per-step screenshots and step-timing waterfall update (`docs/changelog.md` DIF-016).
22. Run completes → mix of pass/fail expected with at least one intentional failure (use a known-bad test or temporarily break a selector).

### 10. AI Fix — fix the failure
23. On a failed test in TestDetail, click **"Fix with AI"** (visible only when `lastResult === "failed"` and `playwrightCode` exists, `frontend/src/pages/TestDetail.jsx:411-426`).
24. SSE stream from `POST /api/v1/tests/:testId/fix` shows incremental tokens; final fixed code appears in the fix panel.
25. Accept the fix → test goes back to **Draft** for re-review (auto-fix never silently re-approves; `backend/src/pipeline/feedbackLoop.js:481-490`).
26. Re-approve the fixed test → re-run **only failed tests** → all pass.

### 11. Visual baseline
27. Run a test with a screenshot step twice → first run creates baseline under `artifacts/baselines/`, second run produces diff = 0.
28. Change something visible on the target → re-run → diff PNG appears at `artifacts/diffs/`, run flagged as visual regression when diff > `VISUAL_DIFF_THRESHOLD` (0.02).
29. Click **Accept visual changes** → baseline updated; subsequent run passes.

### 12. Run results, artifacts & reports
30. On RunDetail verify: per-test status, per-step screenshots, per-step timing, video, network logs, browser badge, parallelism used.
31. Download/inspect artifacts (screenshots, video, trace zip) — files exist and open.
32. Open **`/reports`** page → renders run/test reports for the workspace.
33. From Dashboard, export the **executive PDF report** → file downloads, opens, contains pass-rate / defect breakdown / trends matching on-screen widgets.
34. **Out of scope (planned, not shipped):** embedded Playwright trace viewer (`DIF-005`), public/shareable report links. Do not test these. Standalone Playwright project export (`DIF-006`) **is** shipped — it has its own line item under "Export & traceability" below.

### 13. Notifications
35. Configure Teams + email + generic webhook for PRJ-Demo. Trigger a failing run → notification arrives on each enabled channel within ~1 min, with project / test / runId / failure reason / link.

### 14. Automation (CI/CD)
36. Create a trigger token → plaintext shown **once**.
37. `POST /api/projects/PRJ-Demo/trigger` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` → returns **202** with `{ runId, statusUrl }`. Poll `statusUrl`; final state matches RunDetail.
38. Set a cron schedule for "every minute" → wait → run fires automatically; disable schedule.

### 15. Export & traceability
39. Export tests as **Zephyr CSV** and **TestRail CSV** → non-empty files, correct headers.
40. Open **Traceability matrix** → maps tests ↔ source URLs / requirements.
41. **Standalone Playwright project ZIP** (DIF-006) — `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/export/playwright` → ZIP downloads with `Content-Type: application/zip`, contains `package.json`, `playwright.config.ts` (with `baseURL` from project), `README.md`, and one `tests/<slug>.spec.ts` per **approved** test (drafts and rejected tests excluded). Unzip, `npm install`, `npx playwright test` runs the suite without modification.

### 16. AI Chat
42. Open `/chat`. Ask: "How many tests failed in the last run?" → matches RunDetail.
43. Ask: "Why did test X fail?" in same session → multi-turn context preserved; answer references actual logs.
44. Export the session as Markdown and JSON.

### 17. Dashboard
45. Open Dashboard → pass-rate, defect breakdown, flaky detection, MTTR, growth trends all populated and match RunDetail / Tests source-of-truth counts.

### 18. Recycle bin & audit
46. Delete a test → it appears in **Settings → Recycle Bin**. Restore it → reappears in active list with steps intact.
47. Open **Audit Log** → every approve/reject/run/fix/restore action above is recorded with `userId` + `userName`.

### 19. Account / GDPR
48. Settings → Account → **Export account data** (password-confirmed) → JSON downloads with workspaces/projects/tests/runs/activities/schedules/notification settings.
49. Two-click **Delete account** with 5s auto-disarm → account gone; subsequent login fails.

### 20. Permissions sanity (negative)
50. As User C (`viewer`), confirm: cannot create/edit/delete projects, cannot trigger runs, cannot accept baselines, cannot create trigger tokens or schedules. Each blocked action returns 403, not a silent no-op.
51. As User D (outsider), confirm: any direct URL or API request for WS-1 resources returns 403, never empty 200.

> ✅ **Pass criterion:** all 51 steps green. Any failure = release blocker.

---

## ✅ Functional Test Areas

Each area uses this format:
- **Preconditions** — required state before testing
- **Steps** — actions to perform
- **Expected** — measurable pass criteria
- **Negative / edge cases** — must also pass

---

### 🔐 Authentication

**Preconditions:** Logged out, fresh incognito window.

**Happy path:**
1. Register new user with valid email + strong password.
   - **Expected:** Verification email arrives within 60s; UI shows "verify email" state.
2. Click verification link.
   - **Expected:** Account marked verified; redirects to onboarding/dashboard.
3. Logout, then login.
   - **Expected:** Session cookie set; lands on last-visited workspace.
4. Forgot password → reset link → set new password.
   - **Expected:** Old password rejected; new password works; reset link is single-use.

**Negative / edge:**
- Wrong password → generic error (no user enumeration); auth endpoints rate-limited to **5–10 requests / 15 min per IP** (`README.md` security table). Hammer the endpoint and confirm 429.
- Expired verification link → clear error, option to resend.
- Expired / reused password reset link → rejected.
- Weak password → blocked at form level with reason.
- Register with already-used email → generic error (no enumeration).
- Session expiry mid-flow → redirected to login, returns to original page after re-auth.
- Two concurrent sessions (browser A + B) → both work; logout in A does not invalidate B unless "logout all" is used.
- Tampered JWT / cookie → 401; UI redirects to login.

---

### 👥 Workspaces

**Preconditions:** User A logged in.

**Steps & expected:**
1. Create workspace "WS-Test" → appears in switcher; User A is Owner.
2. Switch workspaces → URL updates, data scoped correctly, no leakage from previous workspace.
3. Invite User B by email → invite email arrives; pending state visible to Admin.
4. User B accepts → appears in member list with assigned role.
5. Change User B's role `qa_lead` → `viewer` → permissions update **without requiring relogin** (role is re-resolved from DB on every request, ACL-001/002).
6. Remove User B → active session loses access on next request (≤ 60s).

**Negative / edge:**
- User B (`qa_lead`) tries to invite users → blocked (admin-only, `routes/workspaces.js:134`).
- Outsider opens workspace URL directly → 403 / redirect, not 200 with empty data.
- Duplicate invite → handled gracefully.
- Invite to non-existent email → still sends (or clear UX); no crash.

---

### 📁 Projects

**Preconditions:** Workspace exists.

**Steps & expected:**
1. Create project (`qa_lead` or `admin`, `routes/projects.js:46`) → appears in list; slug/URL unique.
2. **Edit project** (ENH-036, `qa_lead` or `admin`, `routes/projects.js:96` — `PATCH /api/v1/projects/:id`):
   - Click the pencil-icon button on a project card in `/projects` → routes to `/projects/new?edit=<id>` with name/URL pre-filled.
   - Auth toggle reflects whether credentials are configured server-side; password fields render `"•••••• (saved — leave blank to keep)"` placeholder.
   - Change the name and URL only → save → server merges with existing encrypted `username`/`password` and legacy `usernameSelector`/`passwordSelector`/`submitSelector` (no data loss; secrets never round-trip through the client).
   - Rotate the password (enter a new value) → save → next crawl uses the new credential. Verify by re-running the project's crawl.
   - Clear the auth toggle → save → server stores `credentials: null` and the project crawls without auth.
   - Edit a project that was created with explicit CSS selectors (legacy) → save name change only → confirm the legacy `usernameSelector` / `passwordSelector` / `submitSelector` are NOT silently wiped (regression guard for the merge logic).
   - Pristine edit (open + Back without typing) → no "Leave without saving?" prompt fires (`isDirty` baseline check).
3. **Delete project (admin-only**, `routes/projects.js:147`) → moved to recycle bin, no longer in active list. As `qa_lead`, attempting delete returns **403**.
4. Restore from recycle bin (`qa_lead` or `admin`, `routes/recycleBin.js:54`) → returns to active list with data intact (tests, runs, baselines).
5. **Permanently purge (admin-only**, `routes/recycleBin.js:132`) → unrecoverable; associated runs/tests gone. `qa_lead` purge attempt → 403.

**Negative / edge:**
- Two users edit same project simultaneously → last-write-wins or conflict warning (document behavior).
- Delete project with active running tests → runs stopped/completed cleanly, no orphans.
- Viewer attempts any project mutation (create/edit/delete/restore/purge) → 403.
- `qa_lead` attempts delete or purge → 403 (admin-only ops).

---

### 🧪 Tests Page

**Preconditions:** Project exists.

**Steps & expected:**
1. Crawl URL — verify **both crawl modes** (`README.md`):
   - **Link Crawl** — follows `<a>` tags, maps pages.
   - **State Exploration** — clicks/fills/submits to discover multi-step flows (auth, checkout).
   Each mode completes, discovered pages listed, progress visible. **Primary output: UI / browser tests** (see §3 below). Same-origin fetch/XHR is also captured and powers API test generation as a secondary output (see §4).
2. Generate tests — verify the **8-stage AI pipeline** runs (`README.md`): discover → filter → classify → plan → generate → deduplicate → enhance → validate. Tests appear in **Draft** queue (`README.md`: "Nothing executes until a human approves it").
3. **UI / browser test generation (default output)** — three paths, all produce tests that drive a real browser:
   - During **Link Crawl**: discovered pages → Playwright tests with `page.goto(...)` + `getByRole` / `getByLabel` / `getByText` + ≥ 3 `expect(...)` assertions on visible UI state.
   - During **State Exploration** crawl: multi-step flows (login, form submit, checkout) → tests using `safeClick` / `safeFill` so self-healing engages at run time.
   - **Recorder**: user-driven click/fill/press/select/navigate (see Recorder section).
   Each path produces a Playwright test that opens a browser, navigates pages, and asserts on rendered DOM. **No `request.fetch` / `request.get` / `request.post` calls.**
4. **API test generation (additional output)** — three paths, all produce Playwright `request` tests (no browser):
   - During crawl: same-origin fetch/XHR auto-generated as Playwright `request` tests.
   - "Generate Test" modal: plain-English endpoint description.
   - Paste `METHOD /path` patterns or attach an OpenAPI spec.
   Each path produces tests that verify status codes, JSON shape, error payloads.
5. Approve test → moves to active suite; appears in run targets.
6. Reject test → removed/archived; excluded from regression.
7. Edit test steps (add/remove/reorder) → saved; preview reflects changes.
8. **Search** tests via `?search=` (`/api/v1/projects/:id/tests?search=`) → filters list correctly; empty results show empty state.
9. **Exports** (`backend/src/routes/tests.js`):
   - `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/tests/export/zephyr` — Zephyr Scale CSV.
   - `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/tests/export/testrail` — TestRail CSV.
   - `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/tests/traceability` — traceability matrix.
   - `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/export/playwright` — standalone Playwright project ZIP (approved tests only — DIF-006).
   Each downloads a non-empty file with correct headers; re-importing into the target tool round-trips cleanly. The Playwright ZIP must run with `npm install && npx playwright test` after unzipping.

**Negative / edge:**
- Crawl an unreachable URL → clear error, no infinite spinner.
- Crawl an auth-gated site → documented behavior (login support or graceful failure).
- Generate tests with empty crawl → no crash; clear empty state.
- Edit test, refresh before save → unsaved-changes warning.
- Concurrent edits by two users → last-write-wins or conflict UI.

### 🎥 Recorder

**Preconditions:** Project exists; recorder extension/feature available.

**Steps & expected:**
1. Start recorder on any stable site (same target as the Tests crawl step) → recording indicator visible. Recorder uses Playwright CDP screencast; the canvas is **interactive** — pointer / keyboard / wheel events are forwarded to the headless browser via the new `POST /api/v1/projects/:id/record/:sessionId/input` route (see `docs/changelog.md` DIF-015 + PR #115). Persists a Draft test with `safeClick` / `safeFill`.
2. Perform actions captured by the recorder (PR #115 + #118 expanded scope): **click, double-click, right-click, hover, fill (type), press (keyboard shortcut), select (dropdown), check / uncheck, file upload, drag-and-drop, and navigate**. Mouse moves and scroll are forwarded to the headless browser but not stored as discrete steps. Mouse moves are throttled to ~30 fps client-side.
   - **Hover with intent** — pointer rests on the same interactive element for ≥ 600 ms IS captured as a discrete `hover` step. Drive-by mouseovers are filtered out by the dwell timer (`backend/src/runner/recorder.js:282-309`).
   - **Double-click** — the two preceding `click` events captured for the same selector are dropped within the OS double-click window (`TIMINGS.DBLCLICK_WINDOW_MS` = 500 ms) so the recorded action list reads as a single dblclick, not click-click-dblclick (`backend/src/runner/recorder.js:931-944`).
   - **Right-click** records as `rightClick` and emits `locator.click({ button: 'right' })` so context-menu-driven flows replay correctly.
   - **File upload** captures filenames only (no full paths — would leak tmpdir). The generated code emits a `safeUpload(sel, [])` placeholder + a `// NOTE: recorder captured filenames […]` comment; reviewers must wire up real fixture paths before running outside the recorder.
   - **Drag-and-drop** pairs `dragstart` + `drop` → `locator.dragTo(targetLocator)` in the generated code.
   - **Printable characters typed into INPUT/TEXTAREA/contenteditable** are intentionally NOT captured as `press` steps — the `input` event handler captures them as a debounced `fill`, so emitting per-keystroke `keyboard.press` would double-type the value at replay (`backend/src/runner/recorder.js:370-372`). Keyboard chords with `Ctrl`/`Cmd` modifiers, plus editing keys (Enter, Tab, Backspace, arrows, Escape), still flow through to `press` actions.
   - **Manual assertions** (PR #118) — while recording, use the "Add assertion" form in `RecorderModal` to insert assertion steps. Four assertion kinds are supported: `assertVisible`, `assertText`, `assertValue`, `assertUrl` (`backend/src/routes/tests.js:1164-1184`, `backend/src/runner/recorder.js:827-855`). Server-side validation rejects assertions missing required fields (selector for visible/text/value, value for text/value/url) with a 400.
   - **Expected:** Each captured action is a discrete step with selector + action type; no empty/null steps. Persisted `steps[]` are short English sentences with **single quotes** (`User clicks the 'Sign in' button`, `User fills in the 'Email' field with 'user@example.com'`, `The 'Toast' is visible`) — **never raw selectors** like `role=button[name="…"]` or `#login`. Generated `playwrightCode` uses `safeClick` / `safeFill` / `safeSelect` / `safeCheck` / `safeUncheck` / `safeUpload` so self-healing engages at run time. The persisted `steps[]` count exactly matches the `// Step N:` comment count in `playwrightCode` — the shared `filterEmittableActions` predicate (`backend/src/runner/recorder.js:634-665`) drops actions missing required fields from both outputs identically (PR #118).
3. Stop and save → test appears in Tests page with all steps intact after refresh. The Test Detail Steps panel renders the recorded test identically to AI-generated and manually-created tests (no engineer-shaped strings).
4. Replay the recorded test → all steps execute; pass status reported.
5. **Default Chromium headless mode** — confirm `BROWSER_HEADLESS=true` (the default) no longer produces "no actions were captured" (PR #115). The previous bug was that the canvas was read-only — it now forwards input correctly even when the headless Chromium has no visible window.

**Negative / edge:**
- ⚠️ Known: empty-steps bug (legacy) — verify every recorded step has a selector and action. PR #118's `filterEmittableActions` drops ill-formed actions from both `steps[]` and `playwrightCode` so the two stay in lock-step.
- Record on SPA with client-side routing → navigations captured correctly. Consecutive `goto` actions to the **exact same URL** collapse to a single Step (e.g. `framenavigated` echoes); query-string-distinct navigations (`/search?q=iphone` → `/search?q=macbook`, pagination `?page=N`) are preserved as separate Steps so query-driven flows replay correctly (PR #115 + PR #118 fix).
- Record on iframe / shadow DOM content → recorder captures iframe-scoped actions and emits the correct `frameLocator(…)` chain in generated code (`backend/src/runner/recorder.js:677-707` — `ensureFrame` helper). Selector quality inside iframes still tracked under DIF-015b.
- Record across tabs/popups → popups are aliased as `popup1`, `popup2`, etc., and the generated code includes an `ensurePopup(alias)` helper (`backend/src/runner/recorder.js:688-700`). The `pageAlias` field on each captured action routes the replay through the correct page.
- Close tab mid-recording → partial recording saved or discarded cleanly (no corrupted state). The `MAX_RECORDING_MS` safety-net teardown closes the stub `runs` row so subsequent runs on the project are not blocked (PR #115). Operators who hit "Stop & Save" within `RECORDER_COMPLETED_TTL_MS` (default 2 min) of the auto-teardown still recover their captured actions from the completed-recordings cache (`backend/src/runner/recorder.js:143-162`).
- Record on site with dynamic IDs → selectors are stable (data-testid / role+name / label / text / placeholder fallback chain), not brittle.
- **Scroll inside the canvas** → only the recorded page scrolls; the surrounding modal / page must not scroll underneath (PR #115 — non-passive wheel listener).
- **Type printable characters** → each character appears once in the recorded form input. (PR #115 fixed a regression where every keystroke was inserted twice; PR #118 added the editable-field guard at `backend/src/runner/recorder.js:370-372` and a regression test in `backend/tests/recorder.test.js` to lock it down.)
- **Left / middle / right mouse button** → CDP receives the correct button name. PR #115 P1 fix mapped DOM `MouseEvent.button` 0→`"left"`, 1→`"middle"`, 2→`"right"`. Idle hovers (no button held) dispatch `"none"` so the move isn't interpreted as a left-button drag. Regression test at `backend/tests/recorder.test.js` (`maps DOM button 0 → CDP 'left'`).
- **Right-/middle-click drag** → forwards the correct CDP button. Verify by recording a right-click context menu on a page that has one — the menu opens, no left-click drag artefact appears.
- **Re-recording after a previous crashed session** → opens cleanly; no UNIQUE constraint error on the `runs` row. The orphan sweep at `POST /record` (`backend/src/routes/tests.js:881-902`) only clears `record`-type orphans — concurrent crawl / regression / generate runs are intentionally left alone.
- **Permissions** — every recorder route is gated by `requireRole("qa_lead")`: `POST /record`, `POST /record/:sessionId/input`, `POST /record/:sessionId/assertion`, `POST /record/:sessionId/stop`. Viewer attempts return 403 (`backend/src/middleware/permissions.json:22, 30-32`).
- **Rate limiting** — the `/input` route is exempt from the global rate limiter (`backend/src/middleware/appSetup.js`) because canvas events arrive at ~60 fps during active use. The exemption is scoped to `POST` requests matching `/record/:sessionId/input` only; `/record` and `/record/:sessionId/stop` are still rate-limited.
- **Assertion validation** — `POST /record/:sessionId/assertion` rejects payloads with invalid `kind` (anything other than `assertVisible` / `assertText` / `assertValue` / `assertUrl`) with 400. Missing `selector` for non-`assertUrl` kinds → 400. Missing `value` for `assertText` / `assertValue` / `assertUrl` → 400. Verify each branch returns a clear error message.
- **Step prose contract** — the persisted `steps[]` array must NEVER leak raw `role=…[name="…"]` selectors, `#id` CSS, or `.class` selectors into the rendered step. The fallback chain (`label` → role-selector name extraction → empty target phrase) at `backend/src/runner/recorder.js:440-489` is property-tested at `backend/tests/recorder.test.js` (`never leaks raw role=…[name="…"] or CSS selectors into the rendered step`).

---

### ▶️ Runs

**Preconditions:** At least one approved test.

**Steps & expected:**
1. Run single test → status: queued → running → passed/failed; logs, screenshots, video available.
2. Run regression suite → all tests execute; summary shows pass/fail counts matching detail view.
3. **Cross-browser run selector** (`docs/changelog.md` DIF-002) — trigger run with each engine: **Chromium** (default), **Firefox**, **WebKit**. Each run record persists `browser` (migration 009); RunDetail page shows a per-run badge.
4. **Mobile device emulation** (`docs/changelog.md` DIF-003) — pass `device` (e.g. `"iPhone 14"`, `"Pixel 7"`) → run uses Playwright device profile (viewport, user agent, touch). Verify dropdown lists curated devices.
5. **Parallel execution** (`README.md`) — set parallelism 1–10 from UI (or `PARALLEL_WORKERS`). Verify each worker has isolated video/screenshots/network logs; default is 1.
6. **Live run view** — RunDetail streams logs via SSE, shows per-step screenshots, and exposes **Abort** action mid-run.
7. **Abort run** → run marked `stopped`; partial results retained; per-test hard timeout is `BROWSER_TEST_TIMEOUT` (default **120 000 ms**, `AGENT.md`).
8. Re-run failed tests only → only previously-failed tests execute.
9. **Self-healing** (`README.md`) — break a primary selector, re-run; runtime tries role → label → text → aria-label → title, remembers the winner per element. Confirm subsequent run picks the previously-successful strategy first.

**Negative / edge:**
- Trigger run while another is in progress → concurrency = `PARALLEL_WORKERS` (default **1**, `AGENT.md`). Extra runs queue; no crash.
- Run test against unreachable target → fails with clear network error, not timeout silence.
- Long-running / hung test → aborted at `BROWSER_TEST_TIMEOUT` with a clear timeout error.
- **Flaky test (intermittent failure)** → product-level auto-retry **IS** wired (AUTO-005, PR #2). Each test failure triggers up to `MAX_TEST_RETRIES` retries (default **2**, max 10, set to `0` to disable) before the result is recorded as truly failed. Verify via `result.retryCount` (number of retries actually consumed) and `result.failedAfterRetry` (true only when all attempts failed). A test that fails once then passes shows `retryCount: 1, status: "passed"` — notifications and failure counters fire only on `failedAfterRetry: true` (`backend/src/runner/retry.js`, `backend/src/testRunner.js:229-240`). **Note:** only the FINAL attempt's video / screenshots / trace are preserved on disk — earlier attempts overwrite each other (intentional; see retry.js JSDoc § "Artifact overwrite behaviour"). Self-healing (`safeClick` / `safeFill` selector waterfall) is a separate, lower-level recovery layer — DIF-015b's nth=N disambiguation also reduces flake at recording time.
- Viewer attempts to trigger run → blocked.
- `qa_lead` stops another user's run → **allowed** (no per-user "own runs" gate exists in code, `routes/runs.js:257` only requires `qa_lead`). If product intent is to restrict to the run's owner, file as security enhancement.
- Browser close mid-run → run continues on backend; status visible on return.

---

### 🪄 AI Fix (failed test recovery)

**Preconditions:** A test exists with `playwrightCode` and `lastResult === "failed"` (or its latest run result is failed). AI provider configured. Role: `qa_lead` or `admin` (`backend/src/routes/testFix.js:152` — `requireRole("qa_lead")`).

**Manual fix flow:**
1. Open the failed test in TestDetail → **"Fix with AI"** button visible only when failed and code present (`frontend/src/pages/TestDetail.jsx:411-426`).
2. Click → `POST /api/v1/tests/:testId/fix` opens an **SSE stream** with incremental tokens.
3. Fix panel shows the proposed new code with a diff against the current code.
4. Accept → test goes back to **Draft** state for re-review (never silently re-approved — `backend/src/pipeline/feedbackLoop.js:481-490`).
5. Re-run the test after re-approval → previously-failing assertion passes.

**Automatic feedback loop** (`backend/src/pipeline/feedbackLoop.js:443-496`):
6. On a regression run with failures, only **high-priority categories** are auto-regenerated: `SELECTOR_ISSUE`, `URL_MISMATCH`, `TIMEOUT`, `ASSERTION_FAIL`, `NETWORK_MOCK_FAIL`, `FRAME_FAIL`, `API_ASSERTION_FAIL` (`backend/src/pipeline/feedbackLoop.js:358-366`).
7. Regenerated tests appear in **Draft** with `_regenerated` / `_regenerationReason` metadata; `qualityAnalytics` attached to the run.
8. Flaky-test detection runs and is exposed in `analytics.flakyTests` on the run record.

**Negative / edge:**
- No AI provider configured → button still clickable, server returns **503** with a clear "Go to Settings" message (`testFix.js:162-166`).
- Test with no `playwrightCode` → server returns **400** "Test has no Playwright code to fix" (`testFix.js:158-160`).
- Viewer attempts to call `/fix` → 403 (role gate).
- Cancel SSE mid-stream → no partial update persisted.
- AI returns malformed code → surfaced as "invalid output" error, original code untouched.
- Fix run mid-execution → abort signal honored, no half-applied changes (`feedbackLoop.js:478`).

### ✏️ Test Code Editing (Steps ↔ Source)

**Preconditions:** Approved test with `playwrightCode`. Open TestDetail.

**Toggle & view:**
1. Steps / Source toggle present (`frontend/src/pages/TestDetail.jsx:125-126`). Default = Steps.
2. **Steps tab** — list of plain-English steps; can add, remove, reorder, edit text inline.
3. **Source tab** — full Playwright code, monospace, editable.

**Code regeneration on step edit** (`backend/src/routes/tests.js:154-273`):
4. Edit a step → save → **preview** mode kicks in: diff panel shows old vs new code with **minimal changes only** (existing helpers, comments `// Step N:`, structure preserved).
5. The new code starts with `await page.goto(...)`, uses role-based selectors, has ≥ 3 `expect(...)` assertions, includes no `import` statements (cloud prompt at `backend/src/routes/tests.js:218-224`).
6. Accept diff → `playwrightCode` updated; `playwrightCodePrev` set to old code; `codeRegeneratedAt` timestamped.
7. Discard diff → no DB change; the test keeps prior code.
8. The hint banner reads "Code will be regenerated on save — you'll review changes before applying" when editing in Steps view (`frontend/src/pages/TestDetail.jsx:862-875`).

**Direct source editing:**
9. Edit Playwright code directly in **Source** tab → save → persists without going through AI regeneration (steps and code can drift; document this as expected).
10. `isApiTest` flag updates automatically based on code content (`backend/src/routes/tests.js:265`).

**Local provider (Ollama) path:**
11. Switch to a local provider → editing a step still works; backend uses a **shorter prompt**, plain-text response (no JSON wrapper) per `backend/src/routes/tests.js:199-209` and `230-238`. Verify regenerated code still parses.

**Negative / edge:**
- AI provider down → save returns the regeneration error string; original test untouched.
- Concurrent edit by two users → last-write-wins; document if an edit warning is shown.
- Edit and refresh before save → unsaved-changes warning.
- Edit Source to invalid JS → server validation rejects (test would fail to compile at run time); confirm clear error.
- Viewer attempts edit → 403.

**Edit with AI panel** (DIF-007 — `frontend/src/components/test/AiTestEditor.jsx`, `backend/src/routes/chat.js` `test_edit` mode):

**Preconditions:** Test with `playwrightCode` exists; AI provider configured; role `qa_lead` or `admin`.

1. Open TestDetail → toolbar shows **"Edit with AI"** button (only when `playwrightCode` is present).
2. Click → AI editor panel expands with prompt textarea, Generate / Apply buttons.
3. Enter a natural-language instruction (e.g. "Add an assertion that cart total updates after quantity change") → click **Generate edit**.
4. Backend receives `POST /api/v1/chat` with `context: { mode: "test_edit", testName, testSteps, testCode }` → uses dedicated `TEST_EDIT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`; SSE stream returns Markdown with `### Summary` + a fenced ` ```javascript ` block.
5. Frontend extracts the code block via `extractCodeBlock()` → renders a **DiffView** showing before/after.
6. Click **Apply** → `PATCH` saves new `playwrightCode`; panel closes; view switches to **Source** tab; verify code is updated and persisted across refresh.

**Negative / edge:**
- No AI provider configured → server returns **503**; error surfaces in the panel (not silent).
- Empty / whitespace-only prompt → **Generate edit** button disabled.
- AI response without a fenced code block → user-friendly error: "AI response did not include updated code. Try a more specific instruction."; original code untouched.
- SSE provider error mid-stream → real provider message preserved (not overwritten by the generic "no code" message — see `hadError` flag in `AiTestEditor.jsx`).
- Click **Hide AI Editor** mid-generation → panel hides; in-flight stream behavior should not corrupt state (note: in-flight `fetch` continues until completion — see review thread on AbortController).
- Viewer attempts → 403 on save.

---

### ⚡ Automation (CI/CD + Scheduled Runs)

**Preconditions:** Project exists with at least one approved test. Open `/automation` (or use `?project=PRJ-X` deep-link).

**CI/CD trigger tokens** (`docs/changelog.md` ENH-011):
1. Create a token via `POST /api/projects/:id/trigger-tokens` (UI button) → plaintext token shown **exactly once**; refresh and confirm only the SHA-256 hash is stored (never plaintext again).
2. List tokens → no hashes leaked to UI.
3. Trigger a run via `POST /api/projects/:id/trigger` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` → returns **202 Accepted** with `{ runId, statusUrl }`. Poll `statusUrl`; final state matches RunDetail page.
4. Optional `callbackUrl` → callback hits the URL on completion with run status.
5. Revoke token via `DELETE /api/projects/:id/trigger-tokens/:tid` → subsequent trigger calls return 401.

**Scheduled runs** (`docs/changelog.md` ENH-006):
1. Open `ScheduleManager` for a project → set a 5-field cron expression + IANA timezone via preset picker (hourly/daily/weekly).
2. `PATCH /api/projects/:id/schedule` → server validates cron; invalid expression rejected (try `* * *` → 400).
3. Enable schedule → next-run time displayed; persists across server restart (hot-reloaded on save without process restart — verify by saving while watching backend).
4. Disable schedule → cron task cancelled; no runs fired.
5. `DELETE /api/projects/:id/schedule` → schedule removed; `GET` returns null.

**Negative / edge:**
- Viewer attempts to create trigger token or schedule → 403.
- **`qa_lead` attempts to create / revoke trigger token → 403** (admin-only, `routes/runs.js:379, 411`). `qa_lead` *can* create / edit schedules (`routes/projects.js:162, 222`).
- Trigger run with revoked or wrong token → 401, no run created.
- Schedule across DST transition → next-run time correct in target timezone.
- Two schedules firing simultaneously → respect `PARALLEL_WORKERS` queue; no crash.

---

### 🖼️ Visual Testing

**Preconditions:** Test with screenshot steps exists.

**Steps & expected:**
1. First run creates baseline → baseline image saved; status "baseline created".
2. Re-run with no UI change → diff = 0; test passes.
3. Introduce intentional UI change → diff detected; test flagged; side-by-side + diff overlay visible.
4. Accept new baseline → new image replaces old; next run passes.
5. Reject change → baseline unchanged; run remains failed.

**Negative / edge:**
- Anti-aliasing / font rendering differences across OS → `VISUAL_DIFF_THRESHOLD` (default **0.02** = 2% of pixels) and `VISUAL_DIFF_PIXEL_TOLERANCE` (default **0.1**) filter noise (`AGENT.md`). Change `VISUAL_DIFF_THRESHOLD=0` to verify zero-tolerance mode also works.
- Dynamic content (timestamps, ads) → **mask / ignore regions are NOT supported.** `diffScreenshot()` in `backend/src/runner/executeTest.js:343-349` is called with only `{ runId, testId, browser, stepNumber, pngBuffer }` — no mask, region, clip, or exclude params exist. Workaround: tune `VISUAL_DIFF_THRESHOLD` / `VISUAL_DIFF_PIXEL_TOLERANCE`, or stub the dynamic content in the test. Do not test for masking; file as enhancement if needed.
- Viewport size change between runs → diff behavior documented (pass/fail/warn) — confirm actual product behavior and note it in checklist.
- Concurrent baseline accept by two users → last-write-wins with audit trail.
- Very large images → no timeout, no memory crash.

---

### 📊 Dashboard

**Preconditions:** Workspace has runs, tests, and projects with data.

**Steps & expected:**
1. Open dashboard → all charts render within a reasonable time (no formal SLO documented — use ≤ 3s as a guideline and file any regression); no console errors.
2. Verify each widget against source of truth:
   - Pass rate % matches count(passed) / count(total) over selected range.
   - Run count matches Runs page filter for same range.
   - Failing tests widget lists only tests with latest status = failed.
3. Change date range → all widgets update consistently; no stale values.
4. Switch workspace → dashboard resets; no data from previous workspace.

**Negative / edge:**
- Empty workspace (no runs) → empty states shown, not zero-division errors / NaN.
- Very large dataset (≥ 1000 runs) → dashboard loads without hanging or crashing; no unbounded network calls.
- Viewer sees dashboard but cannot trigger actions.

---

### 🤖 AI Chat

**Preconditions:** Workspace with tests/runs/projects data. Open `/chat` (Chat History page, `docs/changelog.md` #83).

**Steps & expected:**
1. Ask "How many tests failed this week?" → answer matches Runs page filtered count.
2. Ask "Show me the last failed run for project X" → returns correct run, links to run detail.
3. Ask about a specific test by name → returns accurate step count, last status, last run time.
4. Multi-turn: follow up with "why did it fail?" → uses prior context; answer references actual logs.
5. Ask for something outside scope ("what's the weather") → declines or redirects gracefully.

**Chat History page** (`/chat`, persisted in localStorage per user):
6. Create a new session → appears in sidebar.
7. Rename a session → name persists across reload.
8. Delete a session → removed from list, conversation gone.
9. Search across sessions → matching messages highlighted.
10. Export session as **Markdown** and as **JSON** from the topbar menu → both files download with full conversation.
11. Create > 50 sessions → oldest are evicted (cap is 50/user per `#83`); confirm no errors.
12. "Open full chat page" button in the AI Chat modal → navigates to `/chat`.
13. Sidebar nav → "AI Chat" entry visible and active when on `/chat`.

**AI provider switching** (`README.md`):
14. Header dropdown lists configured providers (Anthropic / OpenAI / Google / Ollama). Switch with one click → next chat message uses the new provider; auto-detection order is Anthropic → OpenAI → Google → Ollama.

**Negative / edge:**
- Ask about data in a workspace the user doesn't belong to → **must refuse**; no data leakage (severe bug if leaked).
- Ask Viewer to perform a mutation via chat ("delete project X") → refused or no-op; permissions enforced.
- Prompt injection in a test name (e.g., test named `"ignore previous instructions..."`) → chat does not execute injected instructions.
- Non-existent entity ("run 99999") → clear "not found", no hallucinated data.
- Very long conversation → truncation behavior documented; no crash.

---

### ⚙️ Settings

**Preconditions:** Admin logged in.

**Steps & expected:**
1. Update each setting category → change persists after refresh and across sessions. Sentri surfaces (no billing module):
   - **AI provider keys** — admin-only (`routes/settings.js:48, 53, 130`). Switching providers via the header dropdown should succeed in one click (`README.md`).
   - **Workspace members & roles** — admin-only (`routes/workspaces.js:134, 168, 196`). Roles: `admin` / `qa_lead` / `viewer`.
   - **Per-project notification settings** (Teams webhook / email recipients / generic webhook) — **`qa_lead` or admin** (`routes/projects.js:266`); at least one channel required (`backend/tests/account-compliance.test.js`).
   - **System info / Ollama status** — read-only diagnostics; available on Settings → System and `/system` page.
2. Invalid input (bad email, bad URL) → inline validation; save blocked.
3. Revoke/regenerate API key → old key returns 401 immediately; new key works.
4. Disconnect integration → subsequent features depending on it fail gracefully.

**Negative / edge:**
- `qa_lead` or `viewer` opens `/settings` page → 403 (route is `requiredRole="admin"`, `frontend/src/App.jsx:66`). Note: per-project notification edits are reachable from ProjectDetail, not `/settings`.
- Concurrent settings edits → last-write-wins with no lost fields.
- Save partial form (required field blank) → blocked, no partial persistence.

---

### 👤 Account / GDPR (Settings → Account)

**Preconditions:** Logged in. Open Settings → Account tab (`docs/changelog.md` SEC-003 #93).

**Steps & expected:**
1. **Export account data** — click Export, enter password → server validates via `X-Account-Password` header → JSON downloads containing workspaces, projects, tests, runs, activities, schedules, notification settings (`GET /api/auth/export`).
2. Wrong password on export → 401, no file.
3. **Delete account** — two-click confirm with **5s auto-disarm** (UI re-arms after 5s if not confirmed). Final confirm + password → `DELETE /api/auth/account` runs in a single transaction; user logged out; subsequent login fails with "account not found"; all owned workspace data is gone.
4. Wrong password on delete → 401, account intact.
5. Cancel mid-flow → no state change.

---

### 📧 Email Verification (extra cases)

Beyond the Authentication section (`docs/changelog.md` SEC-001 #87):
1. Register → verification email sent via Resend / SMTP / console fallback (depending on env).
2. Try to login **before** verifying → blocked with "verify your email" state on Login page; "Resend" button visible.
3. Click Resend → `POST /api/auth/resend-verification` returns the same response whether or not the address is registered (enumeration-safe). Rate limit applies (5–10/15min).
4. `GET /api/auth/verify?token=` with valid token → user marked verified; tampered/expired token → rejected.
5. Pre-existing users (created before SEC-001 migration 003) are grandfathered as verified — login works without verification.

---

### ♻️ Recycle Bin (Settings)

**Preconditions:** Soft-delete a project, a test, and a run (`docs/changelog.md` ENH-020). Settings → Recycle Bin.

**Steps & expected:**
1. `GET /api/recycle-bin` → returns soft-deleted entities grouped by type, capped at **200 items per type**.
2. Restore a test → `POST /api/restore/test/:id`; reappears in active list with steps intact.
3. Restore a project → cascades to tests/runs deleted **at the same time** as the project. Tests deleted **individually** earlier remain in the bin.
4. Purge a test → `DELETE /api/purge/test/:id`; gone from `GET /api/recycle-bin`; cannot be restored.
5. Viewer attempts restore/purge → blocked.

---

### 🧾 Audit Log

**Preconditions:** Multiple users acting in WS-1 (`docs/changelog.md` #78).

**Steps & expected:**
1. Each mutating action records `userId` + `userName` on the activity entry.
2. Bulk approve/reject/restore → emits **one activity per test**, each tagged with the acting user (not a single bulk row).
3. Filter audit log by user → only that user's actions visible.
4. Audit entries cannot be edited/deleted via UI.

---

### 🔔 Notifications

**Preconditions:** Notifications configured per project. Sentri supports exactly **three channels** (see `backend/src/utils/notifications.js` — `fireNotifications`):
- **Microsoft Teams** — Adaptive Card via incoming webhook.
- **Email** — HTML summary via `emailSender.js`.
- **Generic webhook** — POST JSON to user-configured URL.

Note: **Slack and in-app are NOT supported** — do not test them.

The settings API requires **at least one channel** to be enabled (confirmed by `backend/tests/account-compliance.test.js`: saving with all three blank returns 400).

**Delivery model** (`backend/src/utils/notifications.js:270-305`):
- Channels fire **simultaneously** via `Promise.allSettled(dispatches)` — no queue, no retry, no rate-limit.
- All errors are logged (`[notifications] X failed for runId: ...`) but **never propagated** — a failing notification cannot fail the run.
- Notifications fire **only when `run.failed > 0`** (`notifications.js:256-257`). Successful runs send nothing.

**Steps & expected (per channel):**
1. Trigger a failed run → each enabled channel receives one dispatch. Verify backend log line `[notifications] <channel> notification sent for <runId>`.
2. Notification payload includes: project, test name, run ID, failure reason, link to run detail.
3. Link in notification opens the correct run and requires auth.
4. Disable a channel → no notifications sent via that channel for subsequent runs.
5. Save settings with all three channels blank → API returns **400** ("At least one channel is required").
6. Successful run (no failures) → **no notification** sent on any channel (intentional, `notifications.js:256`).
7. Recovery notifications ("previously failed, now passes") are **not implemented** — do not test for them; file as enhancement if needed.

**Negative / edge:**
- Invalid / non-HTTPS webhook URL → channel call fails; backend log shows `[notifications] Webhook notification failed` warning; **other channels still deliver** (best-effort).
- Slow / hung channel → no timeout in code; the dispatch will wait on the underlying HTTP client default. Verify this does not stall run completion (the run completes regardless because dispatches are best-effort).
- Flood of failures (10+ failed runs in a minute) → **no batching, throttling, or dedup is implemented**. Each failed run sends one notification per enabled channel. File as enhancement if this floods Teams/email.
- User removed from workspace → stops receiving notifications because settings are workspace-scoped.
- Notification payloads contain no PII / secrets / tokens.

---

### 🔒 Security

**Preconditions:** Users A (`admin` WS-1), B (`qa_lead` WS-1), C (`viewer` WS-1), D (outsider, no membership). A owns project P1, test T1, run R1 in WS-1.

**Authorization checks — each must return 403/404, never the resource:**
1. User D opens `/workspaces/WS-1` directly → denied.
2. User D opens `/projects/P1`, `/tests/T1`, `/runs/R1` directly → denied.
3. User D hits any API endpoint for WS-1 resources with their own token → 403.
4. User C (Viewer) issues mutations via direct API calls (POST/PUT/DELETE) → 403.
5. Swap workspace ID in a URL (`/ws/WS-1/...` → `/ws/WS-other/...` where user has no access) → 403, not 200 empty.
6. Change numeric/opaque IDs in URLs (IDOR) on project, test, run, baseline, invite, API key → 403.

**Session / auth:**
- JWT stored in **HttpOnly cookie**; verify `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite` flags in DevTools (`README.md` security table).
- Proactive refresh fires **5 min before expiry** (`docs/changelog.md`); leave a tab idle and confirm refresh happens without redirect.
- Logout invalidates cookie server-side (replay fails).
- Password reset uses DB-backed **atomic one-time claim** tokens (`README.md`, `docs/changelog.md`): reusing a claimed token → rejected; requesting a new token invalidates all prior unused **reset tokens** (`#78`).
- ⚠️ **There is no in-app "change password" endpoint** — only `forgot-password` + `reset-password` (`backend/src/routes/auth.js:687`). Password reset **does NOT invalidate active sessions on other devices** (no token version bump / refresh-token clear). Verify this: log in on browsers A and B → run reset flow on A → confirm B's session continues to work. File as `SEC` enhancement; do not log as a bug against the current build.

**Input / injection:**
- XSS probes in test names, project names, workspace names, chat messages, bug titles (`<script>alert(1)</script>`) → rendered as text, never executed.
- SQL-ish payloads in search/filter inputs → no 500; no data leakage.
- Upload malicious file types (`.exe`, oversized image) to recorder / baseline → rejected with clear error.
- CSRF: submit a state-changing request from a third-party origin → blocked.

**Secrets:**
- API keys never appear in URLs, logs, or client-side bundles.
- Notification payloads, chat responses, error messages contain no tokens or passwords.

---

### 📑 Reports (`/reports`) & PDF Export

**Preconditions:** Workspace with completed runs and approved tests.

**Steps & expected:**
1. Sidebar → **Reports** → `/reports` loads without console errors.
2. Verify the report views available (run summary, test status, defect breakdown, etc. — record the actual list shown).
3. Filter / date-range controls update report content; counts match Runs and Tests pages.
4. From **Dashboard**, click **Export PDF** (executive report) → PDF downloads.
5. Open the PDF → contains pass-rate, defect breakdown, recent activity, and matches on-screen Dashboard widgets.
6. CSV export from **Tests** page (full-detail with step rows, file `sentri-tests-YYYY-MM-DD.csv` per `frontend/src/pages/Tests.jsx:564`) → opens in spreadsheet, header row + per-step rows.

**Negative / edge:**
- Empty workspace → reports/PDF render empty states, no errors.
- Viewer can view reports but cannot trigger destructive actions from them.
- Very large dataset → PDF generation completes; no client crash.

---

### 🖥️ System Diagnostics (`/system`)

**Preconditions:** Logged in.

**Steps & expected:**
1. Sidebar → **System** → `/system` loads.
2. Verify the diagnostics surfaces (record what's shown — typically uptime, version, AI provider status, Ollama status, DB stats, queue stats, etc.).
3. Settings → **System** tab shows the same/related info from `sysInfo` (`frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx`); both should agree.
4. `GET /health` returns `200 { ok: true, uptime, version }` (`backend/src/index.js:270-278`).
5. `GET /config` returns app config including `demoMode` flag and per-user demo quota (see Demo Mode section).

---

### 🆕 New Project Page (`/projects/new`)

**Preconditions:** `qa_lead` or `admin` logged in.

**Steps & expected:**
1. Projects → **New Project** → `/projects/new` loads (separate page, not a modal).
2. Fill name + URL + any optional fields → **Test connection** button probes the URL.
   - Locally, set `ALLOW_PRIVATE_URLS=true` to allow `http://localhost:<port>` (`docs/changelog.md`); off in prod.
3. Save → redirects to ProjectDetail; project appears in `/projects` list.
4. Submit invalid URL / SSRF payload (e.g. `file://`, `http://169.254.169.254/`) → blocked.
5. Submit duplicate name → handled with clear error.
6. Viewer attempts to open `/projects/new` → blocked / 403.

---

### 📋 Runs List (`/runs`)

**Preconditions:** Workspace with multiple runs in different states.

**Steps & expected:**
1. Sidebar → **Runs** → `/runs` loads with table/list of runs.
2. Filter by status (passed / failed / running / stopped) → list updates.
3. Filter by project → only that project's runs.
4. Click a row → navigates to `/runs/:runId` (RunDetail).
5. Sort by date / duration → ordering correct.
6. Pagination (if present) → next/prev pages load without losing filter state.

---

### 📁 Project Detail (`/projects/:id`)

**Preconditions:** Project with approved tests + at least one run.

**Steps & expected:**
1. Open a project → `/projects/:id` loads with project-scoped command center.
2. **Run regression** from this page → uses the project's defaults; opens RunRegressionModal.
3. **Review / approve / reject** tests scoped to this project (does not show other projects' tests).
4. **Export** Zephyr CSV / TestRail CSV / Traceability scoped to this project.
5. **⚡ Automation** quick-link → opens `/automation?project=<id>` with project pre-expanded.
6. Per-status counts widget reflects `GET /api/v1/projects/:id/tests/counts`.
7. Project-scoped **Notification settings** entry point visible to admin.

---

### ☑️ Bulk Actions & Keyboard Shortcuts

**Preconditions:** Tests page (`/tests`) with ≥ 5 tests in mixed statuses.

**Bulk actions** (`POST /api/v1/projects/:id/tests/bulk`, see `backend/src/routes/tests.js:19`):
1. Select multiple tests via checkboxes → bulk bar appears showing "N selected" with **Approve**, **Reject**, **Clear selection** (`frontend/src/pages/Tests.jsx:914-927`).
2. **Bulk approve** → all selected tests move to active suite; **one audit-log entry per test**, each tagged with the acting user (`docs/changelog.md` #78).
3. **Bulk reject** → all selected archived; one activity per test.
4. **Bulk delete** → soft-deletes selected tests into Recycle Bin.
5. **Bulk restore** (from Recycle Bin) → restores all selected.
6. Mixing roles: Viewer cannot use bulk actions → buttons hidden or 403.

**Keyboard shortcuts** (`frontend/src/pages/Tests.jsx:508-518`):
7. `/` → focuses search input (when no input is focused).
8. `a` (with selection) → triggers bulk approve.
9. `r` (with selection) → triggers bulk reject.
10. `Esc` → clears selection.
11. Typing in inputs/textareas / contenteditable → shortcuts **must NOT** fire (verify `INPUT`/`TEXTAREA`/`isContentEditable` guard).

**Command palette** (`⌘K` / `Ctrl+K`):
12. Press `⌘K` (mac) or `Ctrl+K` (win/linux) → palette opens with navigation entries + AI chat entry.
13. Type a page name → fuzzy match; `Enter` navigates.
14. `Esc` closes the palette.

**Negative / edge:**
- Bulk action with 0 selected → action button disabled.
- Bulk action mid-run on the same tests → handled gracefully (queued or rejected with clear error).
- Refresh after partial bulk failure → state consistent (no half-applied bulk).

---

### 🪟 Modals (Tests page)

**Preconditions:** Tests page open.

For each modal: open → fill → submit → close behavior.

| Modal | Trigger | Verify |
|---|---|---|
| **CrawlProjectModal** | "Crawl" quick action | Default project pre-selected; mode picker (Link Crawl / State Exploration); Test Dials presets; submit kicks off crawl + closes modal. **Output: UI / browser tests** (Draft) — `page.goto` + role selectors + `safeClick` / `safeFill`; same-origin fetch/XHR additionally yields API tests |
| **GenerateTestModal** | "Generate Test" | **Default output: UI / browser tests** from the crawl context. API-shaped inputs (plain-English endpoint, OpenAPI upload, HAR upload, `METHOD /path` paste) produce API tests only when explicitly used; submit creates Draft tests |
| **RunRegressionModal** | "Run Regression" | Project picker, browser selector (Chromium/Firefox/WebKit), device dropdown, locale/timezone/geolocation (AUTO-007), network condition (`fast` / `slow3g` / `offline`, AUTO-006), parallelism 1–10; submit opens RunDetail |
| **ReviewModal** | "Review" / opening a Draft | Step-by-step approval queue; Approve/Reject/Skip; advances to next test |
| **RecorderModal** | "Record a test" | Live CDP screencast; record/stop controls; on stop saves Draft |
| **AiFixPanel** | "Fix with AI" on failed test | SSE token stream; diff vs current code; Accept/Discard |

**Common checks for every modal:**
- Click outside or `Esc` closes (only if no unsaved input — otherwise warns).
- Required fields validated inline; submit blocked with clear errors.
- Loading state shown during submission; double-click does not double-submit.

---

### 📤 API Test Imports (OpenAPI, HAR, plain-English API)

> Scope: this section covers **API test** generation paths only. UI / browser tests are generated from crawls and the Recorder — see [Tests Page §3](#-tests-page) and [Recorder](#-recorder).

**Preconditions:** GenerateTestModal open.

**Steps & expected:**
1. **OpenAPI import** — upload a valid OpenAPI 3.x spec → tests generated cover documented endpoints with status + JSON-shape assertions.
2. **HAR import** — upload a captured HAR file → tests generated for same-origin fetch/XHR calls in the HAR.
3. **Plain-English** — describe an endpoint ("POST /api/login expects 200 + token") → API test generated.
4. **`METHOD /path` patterns** — paste lines like `GET /api/users` → matching tests generated.

**Negative / edge:**
- Malformed OpenAPI / HAR → clear error, no crash.
- HAR with cross-origin / sensitive data → only same-origin requests included; auth headers stripped or masked in generated tests.
- Oversized HAR → rejected with size limit message.

---

### 🚀 Onboarding Tour ("Getting Started")

**Preconditions:** Fresh user OR Settings → "Restart Tour" clicked (`frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx:1219-1243`).

**Steps & expected:**
1. First login → onboarding tour appears on `/dashboard`.
2. Tour walks through the primary surfaces (record what steps are shown).
3. Skip → tour dismissed; doesn't reappear on next login.
4. Settings → **Restart Tour** → page navigates to `/dashboard` and tour replays.
5. After restart, the previous "completed" state is cleared (verify via localStorage `onboarding` keys).

---

### 🎟️ Demo Mode & Per-User Quotas

**Preconditions:** Hosted deployment with `DEMO_GOOGLE_API_KEY` set (`docs/changelog.md` #94).

**Steps & expected:**
1. `GET /config` returns `{ demoMode: true, quota: { crawls, runs, generations } }`.
2. As a demo user (no own AI key), per-day quotas enforced: **2 crawls**, **3 runs**, **5 generations** (`demoQuota` middleware).
3. Hit each quota → next call returns 429 / "quota exceeded" with reset time.
4. Add own AI key (BYOK) → quotas bypass, `/config` reflects new state.
5. Counters use Redis when available, in-memory fallback otherwise — verify either by inspecting Redis or restarting backend (in-memory resets, Redis persists).

**Skip in self-hosted / unset env:** confirm `demoMode: false` and no quota headers in responses.

---

### ⚙️ Settings → Data tab (destructive admin actions)

**Preconditions:** Admin logged in. Settings → Data tab.

**Steps & expected:** (per `frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx:1202-1213`)
1. **Clear Run History** — confirms intent → `api.clearRuns()` → all run records + logs/results gone; counts on Dashboard reset.
2. **Clear Activity Log** — `api.clearActivities()` → audit log empty.
3. **Clear Self-Healing History** — `api.clearHealing()` → next run starts the selector waterfall fresh (no remembered winners).
4. Counts displayed reflect current state (`sysInfo.runs`, `sysInfo.activities`, `sysInfo.healingEntries`).
5. Recycle Bin section also accessible from this tab — verify same behavior as `Recycle Bin` section above.

**Negative / edge:**
- Non-admin opens Settings → 403 (route is `requiredRole="admin"`, `frontend/src/App.jsx:66`).
- Clear actions show a confirmation step (no one-click destruction).
- Concurrent runs while clearing → in-flight runs handled gracefully (record observed behavior).

---

### 🔀 Workspace Switcher

**Preconditions:** User belongs to ≥ 2 workspaces.

**Steps & expected:**
1. Workspace switcher visible in sidebar/topbar.
2. Switch workspace → URL updates, all entity lists (projects/tests/runs/activity) scoped to the new workspace; no data leak from previous.
3. JWT carries `workspaceId` hint; role re-resolved from DB on every request (`docs/changelog.md` ACL-001/002 #88) → role change in DB takes effect within one request.
4. Direct API call with mismatched workspace ID → 403.

---

## 📱 Cross-Cutting Checks

Run these against the full browser matrix (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge):

**Responsive / visual:**
- Mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1440px) — no broken layouts, no horizontal scroll, all buttons reachable.
- Dark mode — **automatic** via `prefers-color-scheme` (no manual toggle exists, `README.md:77`). Toggle the OS setting and reload; verify no illegible text, no white flashes, all icons visible.
- High-DPI / Retina — images crisp, no pixelation.

**State & navigation:**
- Refresh mid-flow on every page — no lost unsaved work without a warning; no broken state.
- Browser back / forward — URL and UI stay in sync; no stale modals.
- Open any page in a new tab via URL paste — loads correctly with auth.
- Deep-link to a run/test/project while logged out — redirected to login, then back to the target.

**Sidebar collapse / expand** (PR #1, `frontend/src/components/layout/Layout.jsx`, `frontend/src/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx`):
- Click the `PanelLeftClose` icon in the sidebar header → sidebar collapses to a 64px icon-only rail. Logo, workspace avatar, nav icons (with `title` tooltips), and Settings icon (admin only) remain visible. Active route shows the accent indicator.
- Click the logo or workspace avatar in the rail → sidebar expands back to 216px.
- Refresh any page → collapsed/expanded state persists via `localStorage` key `ui.sidebar.collapsed` (`Layout.jsx:21`). Clearing that key restores the default expanded state.
- Switch between pages while collapsed → main content fills the reclaimed horizontal space; no horizontal scroll.
- Workspace switcher dropdown is closed automatically on collapse (so it doesn't float into the main content area).
- Each rail nav item has a `title` attribute so hovering shows the page name (Dashboard, Projects, Tests, Runs, Reports, Automation, System, Settings).

**Performance:**
- Initial page load ≤ 3s on a local dev build over loopback (no formal SLO documented — file regressions against prior release).
- No memory leaks after 10 minutes of navigation (check DevTools heap snapshot).
- No unbounded network polling (check Network tab).

**Accessibility (spot check):**
- Keyboard-only navigation works on primary flows (tab order, focus rings visible, Enter/Space activates).
- Screen reader announces form errors and modals.
- No formal WCAG compliance target is documented — treat **WCAG 2.1 AA** as the working goal and file contrast / ARIA gaps as Minor.

**Internationalization:**
- Sentri does not document i18n / locale support — the app is effectively English-only. Long English strings must not break layouts; RTL testing is out of scope until locales are added.

## 🚨 Known Issues

> Do **not** re-file these. Link the ticket in your report if you encounter them.

Per the codebase, recorder (DIF-015) and visual diff (DIF-001) were implemented/fixed in `docs/changelog.md`; there is no live "known issues" register in the repo. Treat the rows below as **claims to verify** — if you reproduce any, open a ticket and replace this table with the real IDs.

> **Note:** "Deploy pages failing" and "image push failures" referenced in earlier drafts of this doc apply to the **CD GitHub Actions workflow** (`.github/workflows/cd.yml` — GitHub Pages + GHCR). They are **not user-facing flows** and are out of scope for manual QA. If they fail, escalate to engineering, do not log against a tester's session.

| Issue | Ticket | Repro | Workaround |
|---|---|---|---|
| Recorder empty-steps | ✅ Fixed in PR #118 — `filterEmittableActions` (`backend/src/runner/recorder.js:634-665`) drops ill-formed actions from both `steps[]` and `playwrightCode`. Locked down by a regression test in `backend/tests/recorder.test.js`. Leave the row here for one release as a verification reference. | Record a simple flow; verify `steps.length` equals the number of `// Step N:` comments in the Source tab. | n/a — should not reproduce. File a P1 bug if it does. |
| Visual diff false positives | _open_ | Re-run unchanged suite; check flagged steps | Tune `VISUAL_DIFF_THRESHOLD` / `VISUAL_DIFF_PIXEL_TOLERANCE` |

## ✅ Sign-off Criteria

A release is QA-approved only when **all** of the following are true:
- The **Golden E2E Happy Path** (51 steps) passes end-to-end on Chrome **and** at least one other browser from the matrix.
- Every row in the coverage checklist is ✅ across the required browser matrix.
- The permissions matrix has been verified end-to-end, including Outsider access attempts.
- All Security authorization checks return 403/404 (never the resource).
- No Blocker or Critical bugs are open; Major bugs have owners and ETAs.
- Known issues list is up to date (no new occurrences filed as duplicates).
- Bug reports include the full template (env, build SHA, browser, evidence).

---

## ❗ Rules

- Do NOT stop after the first bug — continue testing the remaining flows.
- Do NOT report a bug without a build/commit SHA and browser+OS.
- Do NOT file duplicates of Known Issues.
- Do NOT mark a flow as passing until **every** expected result is observed.
